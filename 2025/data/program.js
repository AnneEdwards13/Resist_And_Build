Participants will then engage with a reimagined Business Model Canvas tailored for worker co-ops as regenerative enterprises. Our tool centers around key themes: value propositions for workers and customers, ownership structure, revenue streams, cost models, and essential partnerships — all with an emphasis on building for community resilience. The session welcomes a wide audience, from co-op newcomers to seasoned practitioners seeking to expand their understanding of co-ops as adaptable, justice-driven systems.

In many ways, the only way we build trust is through conflict, through how we repair when we rupture. The word conflict means “to strike together,” a friction that throws a hot spark into the room. Fire burns us or warms us, a disturbance that destroys like a wildfire or cleanses like a cultural burn. In fact, conflict is the most renewable energy we have! It’s inevitable when we assemble, organize, and struggle over real issues from the biodiversity of our daily lives. The question isn’t if we have conflict, but what are we doing with the feedback of heat?\nSo many collective movements and cooperative experiments split because of the crushing pinch between top-down repression and internal flameout. We all make mistakes and misunderstand, and we can all get caught in tension and hurt others with coercion. So many of us feel the urgent vital need for grassroots groups and organizations to get good at conflict so we can weave the web of life needed for the liberation of all people. \n\nIn this workshop we’ll dream and scheme how we resist, build, and stay steadfast by:\n• Reimagining conflict as potential to shape not just a problem to solve\n• Identifying common sources of conflict in movements and cooperative efforts\n• Crafting intentions and agreements so accountability is shaped by consent and trust instead of punishment and performance \n• Understanding the relationships between practice, power, conflict, and justice\n• Reveal that we can change our actions and habits through tender struggle and compassionate collaboration \n\nNone of this is cookie-cutter, none of it is a cheat sheet that works in every context.

This workshop will explore how rural and urban communities can promote and protect food sovereignty, environment, livelihood, and support community organizing through farming and gardening. The workshop will feature learnings from two American Friends Service Committee initiatives, the New Orleans Peace by Piece program and the New Mexico People and the Land program. Peace by Piece supports and mobilizes Black youth in New Orleans, focusing on education and community organizing. Together it works to realize sustainable and equitable communities rooted in self-determination. The program confronts systems and institutions of inequality, poverty, and violence by working with the community to build sustainable green space and promote well-being through gardening and political education. The program emphasizes trauma healing, power analysis, Black history, and organizing while promoting local food security. The New Mexico People and the Land program works with farmers and community members in rural, urban and tribal communities. Participants include small scale farmers, low-income children, and land-based people. It protects traditional water rights (acequias), offers farmers support and resources, organizes farmer gatherings, and connects local farmers to food banks and early childhood education centers. It has helped community members gain skills and resources to grow food and medicine in a changing environment while also using a popular education-based process that builds power and raises consciousness. In addition to building alternatives, both programs work with others to resist unjust laws and promote policies that protect the environment and meet human needs.","loc":["TWN Tent 6"],"tags":["BUILD"],"people":[{"name":"Dee Dee Green (AFSC New Orleans program)","id":"46"},{"name":"Blair Minard (AFSC New Orleans program)","id":"47"},{"name":"Patrick Jaramillo (AFSC New Mexico program)","id":"48"},{"name":"Sayrah Namaste (AFSC New Mexico program)","id":"49"},{"name":"Rick Wilson (AFSC US)","id":"50"}]},{"id":"30","title":"PERFORMANCES","date":"2025-05-04","time":"12:30","mins":"90","desc":"Descriptions Coming Soon","loc":["TWN Stage"]},{"id":"31","title":"PLENARY: Solidarity Economy Media & Narrative Change","date":"2025-05-04","time":"12:30","mins":"75","desc":"How to Use Media to Advance a Solidarity Economy: What are the stories that we need to tell to better understand our economy, and lay the groundwork for building a more inclusive, democratic world? \n\nThis panel will offer a highly participatory discussion that will highlight how different forms of media—everything from written stories to podcasts to videos—and story-telling strategies that can advance economic and racial justice and ultimately help build toward a solidarity economy. \n\nAmong the key questions covered in this session are the following: \n*What does solidarity economy media look like and how does it stay accountable to the movements it is trying to support? \n*What does the current ecosystem of solidarity economy media look like? \n*How can groups connect with media to share stories and narrative frames that advance movements? \n*What are the narrative roadblocks to building a solidarity economy and how are those roadblocks overcome? \n*What are the connections between narrative work, policy, and culture? \n*How can people advance new stories about the economy in their own work? \n*What are specific community-based examples where solidarity economy media has successful aligned with and helped advance systemic change toward a solidarity economy? \n\nWe envision the first half of the session being done in a panel format with planned questions like those above, with the second half involving both audience Q&A and also workshop strategies to align with movement media with movement work.

While these counter-institutions form a local base for radical democracy and social liberation, to reach their transformational potential, local movements must form regional, national and international networks to contend with planetary wide crises. In this workshop, we ask how to further unify local approaches to build a movement formation able to bring about the holistic transformation of society.
